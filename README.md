# GMFC101 ‚Äì Farcaster AI Bot Framework

GMFC101 is an AI assistant that answers questions based on podcast and video transcripts. Built for the GM Farcaster Network, it uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to help users discover content in a conversational way.

> üí¨ Ask a question ‚Üí the bot finds relevant transcript snippets ‚Üí generates a helpful answer.

## üß† What It Does

- Analyzes user question to deterimine which route is best for answering:
  - Route 1: Queries a vector database (Pinecone) across all episodes for relevant transcript embeddings
  - Route 2: Retrieves full transcript for 1 single episode from disk
  - Route 3: Retrieves show metadata as context if user asks question that can be answered with show data instead of transcripts
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4-turbo for answer generation
- Designed to support educational or media content archives

This repo includes the core bot logic and sample data to help you run and extend it.

## üõë Disclaimer

This repository includes **sample transcript data only.**  
The full set of GM Farcaster Network transcripts has not been made publicly available.
If you are interested in using them, please reach out.

If you're building your own bot, replace the sample data with your own content in the format provided and provide embeddings.
